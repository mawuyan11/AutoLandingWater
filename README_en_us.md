## Function
As long as the player has a water bucket in hand and falls from a height of more than three blocks, the water will automatically appear on the ground to ensure the player's survival.

No additional buttons are required. The mod automatically detects and triggers.

It is often used in scenarios prone to falling, such as high - altitude construction and canyon exploration.
